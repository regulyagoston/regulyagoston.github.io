I am an Assistant Professor at the [Institute of Economics, Corvinus University of Budapest](https://www.uni-corvinus.hu/elerhetosegek/reguly-agoston/) (Corvinus), an affiliated researcher at [Financial Services Innovation Lab (FSIL)](https://fintech.gatech.edu/#/) part of Scheller College of Business at Georgia Institute of Technology and a visiting faculty at Central European University (CEU).

My research interests are in empirical finance and econometrics. My ongoing research covers topics on 

- the long-run market performance of mergers and acquisitions, 
- policy evaluation with machine learning techniques, and 
- traditional econometrics. 

See more on my research [here](./papers.html).
