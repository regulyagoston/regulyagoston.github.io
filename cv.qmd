## Research Interest

Applied econometrics in finance with special attention on using and improving machine learning methods.
Currently, I am working on corporate events to better understand the implications of events.

## Current Positions

- Assistant Professor -- Corvinus University at Budapest, Institute of Economics
- Affiliated Researcher -- Georgia Institute of Technology (GT), FSIL at Scheller College of Business
- Visiting Professor -- Central European University (CEU), Department of Business and Economics

## Previous Positions and Research Experiences

- *Postdoctoral research fellow* -- Georgia Institute of Technology (GT), FSIL at Scheller College of Business (2022-2023)
- *Junior Researcher* -- Institute of Economics, Centre for Economic and Regional Studies (CERS)
- *Research Assistant* - at CEU, collaborating with University of College London.
	- Conducted research on econometric theory and applications of models where the dependent or explanatory variables are discretized due to surveys, but in fact, they are continuous. During the research, I have collaborated with [MaaSLab](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/energy/research/energy-and-transport/maaslab) at the University of College London, a research group focusing on public transportation and faces challenges due to discretization when modeling.

## Published and Working Papers

- Long-term market performance of merger and acquisitions (WP) - *Joint with Sudheer Chava*
- When and How Much Do Fixed Effects Matter? - *Joint with Felix Chan and László Mátyás*
	- In: Matyas, L. (eds),The Econometrics of Multi-dimensional Panels 2nd Edition, Springer (2024), Chapter 2, pp. 39-60.
- [Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Regression Discontinuity Designs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11640)
	- The paper proposes a causal supervised machine learning algorithm to uncover treatment effect heterogeneity in classical regression discontinuity designs. Extending Athey and Imbens (2016) with leaf-by-leaf regression, I develop a criterion for building an honest “regression discontinuity tree”, where each leaf of the tree contains the RD estimate of treatment conditional on the values of some pre-treatment covariates.
- The Use of Machine Learning in Treatment Effect Estimation (Published) 2022 -- *jointly with Robert Lieli (CEU) and Yu-Chin Hsu (National Central University and National Chengchi University)*
	- In: Chan, F., Matyas, L. (eds), Econometrics with Machine Learning. Advanced Studies in Theoretical and Applied Econometrics, vol 53. Springer, Cham (2022), pp. 79-109.
- [Modelling with Discretized Continuous Dependent Variable](https://github.com/regulyagoston/Split-sampling/blob/master/Modelling_with_DOC_Dependent_Variable.pdf) - *Joint with Felix Chan and László Mátyás*
	- Extends the split sampling methodology of Reguly et. al. (2020) to linear models, when the outcome variable is observed through a discretization process.
- [Modelling with Discretized Ordered Choice Covariates](https://github.com/regulyagoston/Split-sampling/blob/master/Modelling_with_DOC_Dependent_Variable.pdf) - 2020 - *Joint with Felix Chan and László Mátyás*
	- Introduces a new data gathering method the so-called ‘split sampling’, which allows point identification and consistent estimation of parameters via least squares, when the covariates are discretized interval data.
