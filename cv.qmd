## Research Interest

Econometrics with special attention on using machine learning methods to identify heterogeneous treatment
effects in potential outcome framework. Currently I am working on bandwidth selection with causal trees to
estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in regression discontinuity designs.

## Research Experience
 - **Research Assistant** - at CEU, collaborating with University of College London.
	- Conducted research on econometric theory and applications of models where the dependent or explanatory variables are discretized due to surveys, but in fact, they are continuous. During the research, I have collaborated with [MaaSLab](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/energy/research/energy-and-transport/maaslab) at the University of College London, a research group focusing on public transportation and faces challenges due to discretization when modeling.

## Working Papers
- [Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Regression Discontinuity Designs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11640) - *Job Market Paper*
	- The paper proposes a causal supervised machine learning algorithm to uncover treatment effect heterogeneity in classical regression discontinuity designs. Extending Athey and Imbens (2016) with leaf-by-leaf regression, I develop a criterion for building an honest “regression discontinuity tree”, where each leaf of the tree contains the RD estimate of treatment conditional on the values of some pre-treatment covariates.
- [Modelling with Discretized Continuous Dependent Variable](https://github.com/regulyagoston/Split-sampling/blob/master/Modelling_with_DOC_Dependent_Variable.pdf) - *Joint with Felix Chan and László Mátyás*
	- Extends the split sampling methodology of Reguly et. al. (2020) to linear models, when the outcome variable is observed through a discretization process.
- [Modelling with Discretized Ordered Choice Covariates](https://github.com/regulyagoston/Split-sampling/blob/master/Modelling_with_DOC_Dependent_Variable.pdf) - 2020 - *Joint with Felix Chan and László Mátyás*
	- Introduces a new data gathering method the so-called ‘split sampling’, which allows point identification and consistent estimation of parameters via least squares, when the covariates are discretized interval data.
