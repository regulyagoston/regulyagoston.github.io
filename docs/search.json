I received my PhD from Central European University (CEU). My research interests are in empirical finance and econometrics: long-run effect of corporate events on firm’s performance, policy evaluation with machine learning techniques and traditional econometrics.\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, I am working on various projects:\n\nWith Sudheer Chava(Georgia Tech, FSIL) we investigate the long-term effect of M&A on firms’ performance, using synthetic diff-in-diff methodology with multiple twists.\nWith Felix Chan (Curtin University, Australia) and László Mátyás (CEU) we propose a partially penalized (shrinkage) estimators for panel data, where the structure of the fixed effects (FEs) is unknown. We assess the magnitude of the bias for the parameter of interest if the assumed structure is false (e.g. additive time and individual FEs) and show significant improvement, when using our flexible method.\nWith Róbert Lieli (CEU) we extend my former job market paper, proposing causal trees with bandwidth selection in the context of regression discontinuity designs to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects.\n\nI have taught multiple courses at CEU such as data analysis and mathematics. Before CEU I worked for more than three years at the Hungarian Government Debt Management Agency."

Currently I am working on bandwidth selection with causal trees to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in regression discontinuity designs.\n\n\n\n\nResearch Assistant - at CEU, collaborating with University of College London.\n\nConducted research on econometric theory and applications of models where the dependent or explanatory variables are discretized due to surveys, but in fact, they are continuous. During the research, I have collaborated with MaaSLab at the University of College London, a research group focusing on public transportation and faces challenges due to discretization when modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeterogeneous Treatment Effects in Regression Discontinuity Designs - Job Market Paper\n\nThe paper proposes a causal supervised machine learning algorithm to uncover treatment effect heterogeneity in classical regression discontinuity designs. Extending Athey and Imbens (2016) with leaf-by-leaf regression, I develop a criterion for building an honest “regression discontinuity tree”, where each leaf of the tree contains the RD estimate of treatment conditional on the values of some pre-treatment covariates.\n\nModelling with Discretized Continuous Dependent Variable - Joint with Felix Chan and László Mátyás\n\nExtends the split sampling methodology of Reguly et. al. (2020) to linear models, when the outcome variable is observed through a discretization process.\n\nModelling with Discretized Ordered Choice Covariates - 2020 - Joint with Felix Chan and László Mátyás\n\nIntroduces a new data gathering method the so-called ‘split sampling’, which allows point identification and consistent estimation of parameters via least squares, when the covariates are discretized interval data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Economic Association (EEA) and Econometric Society European Meeting (ESEM) 2021 Summer Conference\n\nEEA: Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Regression Discontinuity Designs\nESEM: Modelling with Discretized Continuous Dependent Variable\n\nInternational Association for Applied Econometrics\n\n2021: Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Regression Discontinuity Designs\n2019: Modelling with Discretized Ordered Choice Covariates - Cyprus\n\nBrownbag Seminar Series at the Department of Economics and Business\n\n2021: Heterogeneous treatment effects in regression discontinuity designs\n2020: Ordered Choice Modelling with Discretized Continuous Dependent Variable\n2019: Modelling with Discretized Ordered Choice Covariates\n\nHungarian Society of Economist Yearly Conference\n\n2014: Forecasting the Hungarian Nelson-Siegel Yield Curve with Mixed Factor Model - Budapest\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizer of the Econometrics Reading Group at the Department of Economics and Business at CEU.\n\nOrganized reading group events for Ph.D. students and faculty members, covering various papers from the field of econometrics.
