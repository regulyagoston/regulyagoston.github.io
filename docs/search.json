    "text": "How is it different from classical Synthetic Diff-in-Diffs\nArkhangelsky et al (2021) introduces synthetic control that allows time and unit fixed effects while creating ‘’synthetic control’’ for the (expected) treated unit.\nOther Synthetic Control methods allows to use ‘’covariates’’ that they use to calculate the weights. Note however these variables are unaffected by the treatment. Nice paper on the issue is by Botosaru and Ferman (2019).\nHere we allow to estimate the weights for the control donor pool by using multiple outcome that are affected by the treatment. We also allow pre-event time specific weights that reduces the bias in the estimator.\n\\[ \\hat Y_{it}(1) = \\sum_{i'} \\omega_{i'} Y_{i't} - \\hat \\delta _{pre} \\]\n\\[ \\hat \\delta_{pre} = \\sum_{t=1}^{T_{pre}} \\left( \\hat\\lambda_{t}Y_{i,t} - \\sum_{i'} \\hat \\omega_{i'} \\hat\\lambda_{t} Y_{i't}\\right) - \\hat\\lambda_{0,i} \\]\nwhere the individual unit-weights \\(\\omega_{i'}\\) and the pre-treatment time weigths \\(\\lambda_{t}\\) are estimated by using multiple outcomes. Their optimal values are the solution of the following optimization problem:\n\\[\\hat\\omega_{i'} = \\left( \\hat\\omega_0^K, \\hat\\omega_{i'} \\right) = arg\\min_{\\omega_0\\in \\mathbb{R}, \\omega \\in \\Omega} \\sum_{t=1}^{T_{pre}}\n\\left[ \\Big(\\omega_0 + \\sum_{i'} \\omega_{i'} Y_{i',t} - Y_{i,t} \\Big)^{'} \\hat \\Sigma_t^{-1} \\Big( \\omega_0 + \\sum_{i'} \\omega_{i'} Y_{i',t} - Y_{i,t} \\Big) \\right] + \\zeta^2 T_{pre} \\sum_{i'}\\omega^2_{i'}\\]\nand\n\\[ \\left( \\hat\\lambda_0, \\hat\\lambda \\right) = arg\\min_{\\lambda_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\lambda \\in \\Lambda}\n    \\sum_{i'} \\Bigg[ \\left(\\lambda_0+\\sum_{t=1}^{T_{pre}}\\lambda_{t} Y_{i',t} - \\frac{1}{T_{post}}\\sum_{t=0}^{T_{post}} Y_{i',t}\\right)^{'}\n    \\hat{\\Sigma}^{-1} \\left(\\lambda_0+\\sum_{t=1}^{T_{pre}}\\lambda_{t} Y_{i',t} - \\frac{1}{T_{post}}\\sum_{t=0}^{T_{post}} Y_{i',t}\\right) \\Bigg]\\]\nwhere \\(Y\\) is \\(J \\times T\\), \\(i\\) is the treated units and \\(i'\\) are the controls and during the optimization we constraint both weights to sums up to 1. See more in Chava and Reguly (2024)\nIntuitively it uses information from \\(J\\) outcome and calculate unit specific weigths \\(\\omega_{-i}\\) that minimize the Mahalanobis distance from the treated (average) unit, where the scaler is coming from time specific var-covar matrices. Similarly to Arkhangelsky et al (2021) we add a (ridge) penalty term that shifts weights toward zero.\nFor the time specific weights we use the same approach but scale with unit-specific var-covar matrices."
