## Quick bio
  Recently, I have defended my Ph.D. in Economics at the Department of [Economics and Business at Central European University](https://economics.ceu.edu/) (CEU) and I accepted a post-doc position at [Financial Services Innovation Lab](https://fintech.gatech.edu/#/), Scheller College of Business, Georgia Institute of Technology. My research interests are in econometrics: *policy evaluation with machine learning techniques* and *optimal survey designs*. Currently, I am working on a paper with causal trees and bandwidth selection in the context of regression discontinuity designs with heterogeneous treatment effects. I have taught multiple courses at CEU such as data analysis or mathematics. Before CEU I have worked for more than three years at the Hungarian Government Debt Management Agency. 
  
## *Job market*
  From August I will start as a post-doctoral research fellow at [Financial Services Innovation Lab](https://fintech.gatech.edu/#/), Scheller College of Business, Georgia Institute of Technology US with Sudheer Chava.

## [Working Papers](./papers.md)

My most recent [working paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11640) is on honest causal trees and regression discontinuity design, which extends the potential outcome framework with machine learning techniques. My advisor on this topic is [Róbert Lieli](https://sites.google.com/site/robertplieli/).

I have two joint papers with [Felix Chan](https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/felix-chan-885a727c/) (Curtin University, Australia) and [László Mátyás](http://www.personal.ceu.hu/staff/matyas/) (CEU) on modeling with interval data. These papers propose new survey designs when the variable is observed through a discretization process, but one wants to point-identify parameters in the model.

See more on my publications [here](.papers.md).


## [Teaching](./teaching.md)

In the past few years, I have taught mathematics and data analysis related courses at CEU. I had the fortune to teach on four programs at CEU: MS in Business Analytics, MS in Finance, and Executive MBA.

Currently, I am developing a course material: [Coding for Data Analysis in R](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-rstats), which is aimed to supplement the book *Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy by Gábor Békés (CEU) and Gábor Kézdi (U. Michigan) Published on 6 May 2021 by Cambridge University Press* [gabors-data-analysis.com](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/) and Data Analytics courses at CEU.


More information on the courses are avaliable [here](./teaching.md).
